This is my attempt to improve a friends music box and to understand the problems with the current design.

Here I'll place some simulations of the diy design and the problems that I see in it.
If I can't find a models for the 4093 IC, I'll use the oscilloscope from xoscope to understand, what
actually happens with this circuit.

My approach to design a music box will be called bbox1 and I'll use timer 556 (two timers in one package).
This design should be able to produce stable single frequency and attached sensors should be able to change
the whole frequency band from 50 Hz to 20 kHz according to the applied force.
