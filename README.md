MusicBox
========

Analog circuits for generation of audio waves using capacitive, resistive and other sensors.

Here I'll place some simulations of music boxes and some explanations in the
wiki. My first music box will use timer 555 and switching transistor from an
old pc motherboard working up to 20 V and 20 amps and is called bbox1.

In additon a capacitive and light sensors will be attached.

Different directories are for different schematics and boxes (probably they
will soudn differently).

    bbox1: consists of timer 555, power transistor and speaker.
